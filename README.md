##Running the attached code
You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it.

To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the `cd` command in your command prompt or terminal first.

Then run `npm install`npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder).

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work.
